This might be the question in your head when you were using NotesApp or going through the code.

Well, its very simple.


#### If you are a complete beginner, you can just open up the readme file or any such documentation file and look for any typing or grammatical errors in them. 

If present, just fork this repository, create a new branch and edit the file to rectify those specific errors. Once that is done, commit the changes to the file and simply create a pull request to get it merged if it is a valid error.

If you find any bugs while using the NotesApp or have any suggestions to improve or add any new features to the app, please do so by opening an issue in this repository.

_Remember, creating issues is a great way to contribute to the project! ðŸ˜Š_

#### And if you are an intermediate in Flutter, then?

Well then you can go through the code and fix issues or refactor the code for improved quality, readability or conciseness.


#### More advanced Flutter user? 

Write codes that can be added to the NotesApp to increase its functionalities.
