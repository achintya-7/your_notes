A notes app where you can store your stuff by giving them a title and a description. It will display all the notes in a colourful card like widget. You can also toggle a switch named Important if you have a confidential description and dont want to show it on the note page. 

It uses a Sql database for the storing the data. The best way to check these features is to install the app and use it yourself.

Also comes with local auth if you have any authentication set p in your device.
