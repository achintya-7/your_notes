A notes app where you can store your stuff by giving them a title and a description. It will display all the notes in a colourful card like widget. You can also toggle a switch named Important if you have a confidential description and dont want to show it on the note page. 

It uses a Sql database for the storing the data. The best way to check these features is to install the app and use it yourself.
